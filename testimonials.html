    <h1>Testimonials</h1>

    <div class="testimonials">
      <div class="testimonial_item">My son really enjoyed the camp because there was an excellent, structured, and focused challenge with specific goals. But just as importantly, there were many opportunities of relaxing physical activities. It was an engaging and balanced experience!</div>


      <div class="testimonial_item">If you want your child to go to a camp where they will have their computer interest stretched and their imaginations sparked, you should send them to Rocks and Robots... This class is a great playful way to spark something long term in your child's life. The camp has been instrumental in building [my granddaughter's] self-esteem, expanding her knowledge, and preparing her for down the road.  The sign of a great camp is your child always looking forward to going. If my camper had her way, this camp would be far longer than one week.</div>


      <div class="testimonial_item">This is the second week this summer we did a Rocks and Robots camp and we couldn't be more pleased with how it worked out between the two.</div>


      <div class="testimonial_item">It's a fun and exciting environment.  My son was pumped up every morning and exhilarated to go to go to the camp! I feel my son used his brain and had tons of fun also!!</div>


      <div class="testimonial_item">I just asked my son what he thought of the camp and he said, It is awesome!" and would like to do it again. I love the fact that they are getting exposed to basics and advanced robotics at such a young age. What I think helped me decide to go with this summer camp are: experienced and well-educated staff who are great with kids, plus lots of activities and challenges that engage campers' minds. Robotics and Legos are the best ever combination. The icing on the cake was the rock climbing.</div>


      <div class="testimonial_item">My child came home every day excited about the programming he learned and the mechanical creations he made work. He thought the camp mixed fun with inquiry and exploration.</div>

      <div class="testimonial_item">I was a little apprehensive in signing my son up for this type of class. He is shy, none of his friends were attending, and, though he is very smart and creative, he does not like any sort of competition where his work might be compared to others. He told me after the first day that he wanted to go again. The class structure and staff have created an engaging and safe environment that my son is very comfortable with. He is inspired to do more at home now with Lego building.</div>

      <div class="testimonial_item">My child loved the program, it met his expectations. He told us in detail what he did every day and he is usually a man of few words!  If a child has any interest in robotics, this camp is perfect.</div>

      <div class="testimonial_item">This camp provides a new and exciting experience for your child.  Not the same old, same old. My kid was very excited about programming and battle the robots. He thoroughly enjoyed himself. Well worth the cost!</div>

      <div class="testimonial_item">If you have a Lego-maniac, this is the camp for your family!  It's a completely new and exciting experience.  The instructors and staff know how to run a smooth, no hassle camp for parents. As far as kids are concerned - the blocks and move - need we say more?!</div>

    <h3>My child has special health or social or learning needs. Can you ensure that they will have a great camp experience?</h3>
    <p>Absolutely! For more than 18 years, Rocks and Robots has embraced campers with various learning styles, social habits, and health situations. In these cases, we like to communicate with each parent before camp to create a plan that will ensure that your child has an optimal camp experience.</p>
    <br>

    <h3>What does my child need to bring to camp?</h3>
    <p>We ask that campers bring a water bottle and sunscreen as we'll be spending time outside in the sun. Campers also need to bring their own (peanut-free) lunch. We will provide snacks, typically pretzels and apples, but campers are welcome to bring additional snacks.</p>
    <br>
